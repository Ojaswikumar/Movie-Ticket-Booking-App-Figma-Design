## Overview

- **Seat Selection Screen**: Interactive seat selection layout with VIP and regular sections.
- **Mobile Ticket Screen**: Display mobile tickets with a ticket shape and tab bar for easy navigation.

## Resources

### Icons

### Fonts

- **Poppins Font**: Ensure the font is available in the Figma community or download it.

### Illustrations

### UI Kit

- **iOS 15 UI Kit for Figma**: Created by Joey Banks. Download from the Figma community.

## Design Details

### General

- **Frames**: Use iPhone 13 and 13 Pro frames.
- **Colors**: Specific gradients and colors are used for various elements, including backgrounds and buttons.
- **Auto Layout**: Extensively used for maintaining spacing and alignment consistency.

### Specific Components

- **Reservation Button**: Rectangle (350x60) with 20 corner radius and gradient fill.
- **Chosen Date and Time**: Rectangles with dimensions 50x80 and 70x100, gradient fill, and grouped by Command + G.
- **Top Navigation Button**: Arrow left icon with auto layout and proper spacing.
- **Cinema Screen Layout**: Lines and rectangles with specific dimensions, union selection, and independent corner adjustments.
- **Bottom Cards**: Frame (390x216) with background blur and stroke effects, containing date, time, and ticket information.

### Tips

- **Dark Mode Design**: Avoid pure black and white colors; use reduced opacity (87% for black, 65% for subtitles).
- **Highlighting**: Use linear gradients and neon colors for a highlighting effect.
